    For the purpose of spreading knowledge to every developer especially those who just started to learn how to program, I want to share a list of all resources that I've been collected during my learning journey. 
    - This list will include all my favorite preferences listed below:
        1. Programming blogs
        2. Github repos
        3. UI/UX design tools
        4. Interview Prep Platforms
        5. Online Courses
        6. Books
        7. Others (icons, cheatsheets, images resources)
