A List of Useful Resources to Learn Programming
</h1>
<!-- Introduction Paragraph -->
<p>
    For the purpose of spreading knowledge to every developer especially those who just started to learn how to program, I want to share a list of all resources that I've been collected during my learning journey. I hope you can learn something from things that I share and boost your knowledge. If you have any other resources to add, feel free to do so. <strong>Keep calm and learn programming.</strong>

<i>If you find any grammar mistakes in my writing, please let me know. I am always willing to learn and improve my writing skill.</i>
